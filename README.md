Twin primes visualized over an Ulam Spiral in HTML5
====

Two numbers p and q are twin primes if they are primes and |p – q | = 2.

The Ulam spiral, discovered by the mathematician Stanislaw Ulam in 1963, is a simple method to visualization prime numbers. Put the numbers in a spiral and draw only the ones which are primes.

In the visualization below, I’m drawing the prime numbers in two shades of green. The light green are for twin primes. The dark green is for primes that don’t have a twin.
